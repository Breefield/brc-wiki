We use a combination of vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/) and fabric (http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.8/) to provision production and development environments.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Optional: check out the relevant branch you want to work on
3. See the comment at the top of fabric/fabfile.py for instructions on installation.
